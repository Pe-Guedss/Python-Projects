# Google Sheets API
---
Recently I was asked to develop an RPA to collect data from a Google Sheet, process it and transfer to another Google Sheet. There is a lot of ways to do that, but from far, the one I found more interesting is through the use of APIs.

The "problem" (yes, between quotes because it is not really a problem lol) is: I never used a Google API before.

Thankfully, Google itself provides a great (but a little confusing) documentation about the subject. You can find it in the link below:

https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python

So, in order to gain more knowledge about the fascinating world of the APIs and improve myself as a developer, here it goes :)
